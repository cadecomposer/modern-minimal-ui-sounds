# modern-minimal-ui-sounds
UI sounds adhering to the freedesktop naming standard, made in REAPER using Vital VST.    

These sounds are designed for use with compatible Linux desktops. Feel free if you would like to use them on Windows and the like, however you will have to manually select the sounds in the settings as I will not be providing a .bat script.

## How to install (Linux)

1. Make the directory ~/.local/share/sounds if it does not already exist, and `cd` into it

`mkdir -p ~/.local/share/sounds && cd ~/.local/share/sounds`

2. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/cadecomposer/modern-minimal-ui-sounds.git`

3. Enable the sound theme
  - In KDE Plasma 6, in Settings under Appearance & Style, click on Colors & Themes > System Sounds and select "Modern Minimal UI"
  - In GNOME, install `gnome-tweaks` package for your distribution, then open Tweaks and go to Sound > System Sound Theme and select "Modern Minimal UI"
